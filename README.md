### About Budgy

Budgy is a personal CRUD excersise, to build an interface on react-native for the first time.

It is an app to keep your budgets organised. It will have 2 features:

1. **Personal Budget**: A record of the different payments that will be charged throught out each month.

2. **Event Budget**: A comparison between products on different stores, so you can research and then organise according to your priorities (price and/or location).

To use this app you'll need this [basic server](https://github.com/carrmelo/budgy-server)
